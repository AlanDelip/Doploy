# Doploy

Doploy is a Docker-based configuration tool that helps 
deploy the backend of a web application in a faster and simpler way.

## Description
![](demo/abstracted-process.png)

- Doploy encapsulates a traditional web-backend code base 
into a product that can be deployed to any machine within 
one step, with the help of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

- Doploy works as a blackbox. Background knowledge about Docker, Shell language, 
or deployment techniques is not required.

- [Interactive Doploy Tool](https://www.do-ploy.com/doploy) 
will help you work out all the deployment problems.
